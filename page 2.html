                The original Pok√©mon Ruby and Sapphire games were developed by Game Freak and published by Nintendo for the Game Boy Advance. 
                <br>They were released in Japan in November 2002, followed by releases in North America, Australia, and Europe in 2003. These
                <br> games were well-received by fans for their improved graphics, innovative gameplay, and introduction of new features such as
                <br> Pok√©mon contests and double battles.
                In response to the success of the original versions, Game Freak decided to release enhanced versions titled "Pok√©mon Ruby Alpha" 
                <br>and "Pok√©mon Sapphire Alpha." These games were released on the Nintendo 3DS console in November 2014 in Japan, followed by releases

                <img class="ruby_saphir" src="pokemon-4.webp" alt="pokemon saphir alpha ruby omega"></a>
                <br> in North America, Europe, and Australia in November 2014 as well.
                The development of these enhanced versions involved introducing new features such as mega evolution, which allows players to temporarily
                <br> evolve certain Pok√©mon, giving them enhanced stats and abilities during battles. New challenges, Pok√©mon, and areas to explore were
                <br> also added to provide an enriched gaming experience compared to the original versions.
                The commercialization of Pok√©mon Ruby Alpha and Sapphire Alpha was accompanied by a significant marketing campaign, including TV advertisements, 
                <br>in-store promotions, special Pok√©mon distribution events, and collaborations with other Pok√©mon merchandise. These games were well-received by 
                <br>fans and achieved great commercial success, contributing to the enduring popularity of the Pok√©mon franchise.
